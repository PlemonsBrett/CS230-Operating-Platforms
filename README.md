# The Gaming Room - "Draw It or Lose It"

The Gaming Room was a client seeking to expand their existing Android game "Draw It or Lose It" into a web-based application supporting multiple platforms. The game is a team-based guessing game inspired by "Win, Lose or Draw" where teams must guess phrases or objects based on gradually revealed stock images within time limits. Their key requirements included multi-platform compatibility, support for multiple teams and players, unique identifiers for games and teams, and implementation of the Singleton pattern to ensure only one game instance runs in memory at a time.

I believe I excelled in developing comprehensive technical specifications across multiple aspects of the system architecture, particularly in the detailed platform evaluation and security considerations sections. The process of working through the design document helped enforce a systematic approach to analyzing requirements and constraints before diving into implementation. The domain modeling section with its UML class diagram was especially helpful in visualizing the relationships between different components before writing code. However, if I could revise one part, I would expand the Recommendations section to include more specific implementation details and deployment strategies, particularly around scaling the application as user numbers grow. In interpreting user needs, I focused on both functional requirements (like multi-platform support) and non-functional requirements (like performance and security), recognizing that well-designed software must balance both technical excellence and user experience. Going forward, I would continue using this comprehensive documentation approach but would also incorporate more iterative feedback loops and prototyping stages to validate design decisions earlier in the process. The user's needs must remain central to software design because ultimately, the success of any application depends on how well it serves its intended audience - in this case, creating an engaging, responsive, and reliable gaming experience across multiple platforms.
